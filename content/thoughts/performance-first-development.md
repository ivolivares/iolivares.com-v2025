# Performance-First Development

In today's web landscape, performance isn't just a nice-to-haveâ€”it's a fundamental requirement. Users expect fast, responsive experiences, and search engines reward sites that deliver them.

## The Performance Mindset

Performance-first development means considering the performance implications of every decision:

- **Bundle size** impact of new dependencies
- **Runtime performance** of algorithms and data structures
- **Network requests** and their optimization
- **Rendering performance** and layout shifts

## Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals provide concrete metrics to optimize for:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- **Target**: Under 2.5 seconds
- **Strategies**: Optimize images, preload critical resources, use CDNs

### First Input Delay (FID)
- **Target**: Under 100 milliseconds
- **Strategies**: Minimize JavaScript execution time, use web workers

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- **Target**: Under 0.1
- **Strategies**: Reserve space for images, avoid inserting content above existing content

## Practical Optimization Techniques

### Image Optimization
\`\`\`javascript
// Use next/image for automatic optimization
import Image from 'next/image'

function OptimizedImage() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/hero.jpg"
      alt="Hero image"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      priority // For above-the-fold images
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
    />
  )
}
\`\`\`

### Code Splitting
\`\`\`javascript
// Route-based code splitting
const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./Dashboard'))
const Profile = lazy(() => import('./Profile'))

// Component-based code splitting
const HeavyChart = lazy(() => import('./HeavyChart'))
\`\`\`

### Resource Preloading
\`\`\`html
 Preload critical resources 
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/inter.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
<link rel="preload" href="/api/critical-data" as="fetch" crossorigin>
\`\`\`

## Performance Budgets

Set and enforce performance budgets:

- **JavaScript bundle**: < 200KB gzipped
- **Total page weight**: < 1MB
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3 seconds on 3G
- **Lighthouse score**: > 90

## Monitoring and Measurement

Use tools to continuously monitor performance:

- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)** for actual user experiences
- **Synthetic monitoring** for consistent baseline measurements
- **Performance CI checks** to catch regressions early

Remember: Performance is a feature, not an afterthought. By making it a priority from day one, you'll create better experiences for your users and better outcomes for your business.
